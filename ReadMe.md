#### Project 499
## Image Encryption using the DES algorithm

This is an encryption system that basically performs the operation of image encryption and decryption 
using the DES algorithm and automatically encodes any given key to a 16 byte ascii key with the md5 operation

-- With the use of Cipher it helps in the integration of the Triple DES key, 
-- MODE_EAX for Confidentiality & Authentication and nonce for generating random / pseudo random number which is used for authentication protocol
